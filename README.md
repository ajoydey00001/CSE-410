### **CSE-410**
### **Offline_01** --> Assignment on OpenGL 
**Offline_02** --> I develop the raster-based graphics pipeline used in OpenGL. The pipeline can
be thought of as a series of six stages. I implement roughly 4 stages of the pipeline.
- 1. Stage 1: modeling transformation
- 2. Stage 2: view transformation
- 3. Stage 3: projection transformation
- 4. Stage 4: clipping & scan conversion using Z-buffer algorithm \
### **Offline_03** -->  In this assignment, you have to generate realistic images for a few geometric shapes using ray
tracing with appropriate illumination techniques. \
Prerequisites:
- 1. Basic knowledge of OpenGL (What you have learned in assignment 1 should be
sufficient)
- 2. Fully controllable camera (same as in assignment 1)
- 3. Bitmap image generation using the bitmap image header file provided for assignment 2
- 4. Basic idea of illumination, Phong lighting model to be more specific
- 5. The intersection of lines with different 3D objects (e.g. ray-plane intersection, ray-sphere
intersection, ray-triangle intersection, etc.)
- 6. Multi-level reflection using ray tracing
- 7. Refraction using ray tracing (optional)
